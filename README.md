## Hi, Sabrina here 👋
I'm an undergrad at McGill University studying Neuroscience and Computer Science. Currently, you can find me doing research at the [m2b3 lab](https://m2b3.github.io/) under the supervision of Prof. Suresh Krishna in the Department of Physiology.

My interests lie in NeuroAI, neuromorphic computing, and synthetic biology!
