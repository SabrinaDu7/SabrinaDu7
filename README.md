## Hi, Sabrina here ðŸ‘‹
I'm an undergrad at McGill University studying Neuroscience, Mathematics and Computer Science. Currently, you can find me doing research at the [Peyrache lab](https://www.peyrachelab.com/) where I build curiosity-driven RL agents to model rat exploratory behaviour and hippocampal activity. My interests lie in NeuroAI and the philosophy of science! 

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dusabrina/) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/sabrinadu.bsky.social).
