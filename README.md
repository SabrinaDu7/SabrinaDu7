## Hi, Sabrina here ðŸ‘‹
I'm an undergrad at McGill University studying Neuroscience and Computer Science. Currently, you can find me doing research at the [m2b3](https://m2b3.github.io/) lab under the supervision of Prof. Suresh Krishna

My interests lie in NeuroAI, neuromorphic computing, and synthetic biology!
