## Hi, Sabrina here ðŸ‘‹
I'm an undergrad at McGill University studying Neuroscience and Computer Science. Currently, you can find me doing research with [McGill iGEM](https://igem.org.mcgill.ca/), a synthetic biology group under Prof. Ignea and Prof. MÃ¼nter.

My interests lie in NeuroAI, explainable AI, computational biology and synthetic biology!
